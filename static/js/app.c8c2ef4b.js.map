You won't need to be re-entering your favourite networks every time you open Kiwi anymore.</p> <h4>Mobile and tablet support</h4> <p>Now that over 50% of internet usage is now on mobile, Kiwi has complete mobile support with new layouts and messages. Everything is accessible with just your fingers.</p> <h4>Embedded images and videos</h4> <p>Opening photos and videos within Kiwi now gets pinned at the bottom of the screen. This lets you switch channels, keep talking without it going off-screen, and have that permenant youtube video playing while you're talking.</p> <h4>ZNC integration</h4> <p>When connecting to a ZNC server, Kiwi will now automatically detect it and look for any other networks in your ZNC account. If any are found then they are shown in a list - just one click away from connecting to it.</p> <h4>Aliases editor</h4> <p>A full alias editor to create command aliases to handle users in your channel, administrate your network or project, or even join multiple commands into a single helpful command. Created by a simple text editor that lets you copy/paste/share your aliases wherever you please.</p> <h4>Raw IRC power</h4> <p>If you're a power IRC user or like to get indepth, Kiwi now uses the raw IRC protocol directly in the browser. Look at the raw IRC messages going back and forth, send raw commands, or use it's scripting to test out new protocol ideas and experiments.</p> <h4>The most IRCv3 compliant open source web IRC client</h4> <p>IRC is being pushed forward by the <a href=\\\"http://ircv3.net\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">IRCv3 working group</a> which brings us new features that any IRC client can be using. Not only taking part, but Kiwi is one of the most IRCv3 complete web clients that exists.</p> \";\n// Exports\nmodule.exports = code;","var render = function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _c('div',{staticClass:\"kiwi-serverview\"},[_c('div',{staticClass:\"kiwi-serverview-inner\"},[_c('tabbed-view',{key:_vm.network.id,ref:\"tabs\",on:{\"changed\":_vm.tabChanged}},[_c('tabbed-tab',{attrs:{\"header\":_vm.$t('messages'),\"focus\":_vm.hasMessages,\"name\":\"messages\"}},[_c('message-list',{attrs:{\"buffer\":_vm.serverBuffer}})],1),(!_vm.restrictedServer)?_c('tabbed-tab',{attrs:{\"header\":_vm.$t('settings'),\"focus\":!_vm.hasMessages,\"name\":\"settings\"}},[_c('network-settings',{attrs:{\"network\":_vm.network}})],1):_vm._e(),(_vm.networkConnected)?_c('tabbed-tab',{attrs:{\"header\":_vm.$t('channels'),\"name\":\"channels\"}},[_c('channel-list',{attrs:{\"network\":_vm.network}})],1):_vm._e(),_vm._l((_vm.pluginUiElements),function(item){return _c('tabbed-tab',{key:item.id,attrs:{\"header\":item.title}},[_c(item.component,_vm._b({tag:\"div\"},'div',item.props,false))],1)})],2)],1)])}\nvar staticRenderFns = []\n\nexport { render, staticRenderFns }","export * from \"-!../../../node_modules/@vue/cli-service/node_modules/mini-css-extract-plugin/dist/loader.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-0!../../../node_modules/css-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-1!../../../node_modules/@vue/cli-service/node_modules/vue-loader/lib/loaders/stylePostLoader.js!../../../node_modules/postcss-loader/src/index.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-2!../../../node_modules/@vue/cli-plugin-babel/node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../build/webpack/exports-loader.js!../../../node_modules/@vue/cli-service/node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./Welcome.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&lang=css&\"","export * from \"-!../../../node_modules/@vue/cli-service/node_modules/mini-css-extract-plugin/dist/loader.js??ref--10-oneOf-1-0!../../../node_modules/css-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--10-oneOf-1-1!../../../node_modules/@vue/cli-service/node_modules/vue-loader/lib/loaders/stylePostLoader.js!../../../node_modules/postcss-loader/src/index.js??ref--10-oneOf-1-2!../../../node_modules/less-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--10-oneOf-1-3!../../../node_modules/@vue/cli-plugin-babel/node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../build/webpack/exports-loader.js!../../../node_modules/@vue/cli-service/node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./TextStyle.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&lang=less&\"","import { render, staticRenderFns } from \"./UserBox.vue?vue&type=template&id=e1f770aa&\"\nimport script from \"./UserBox.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\nexport * from \"./UserBox.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\nimport style0 from \"./UserBox.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&lang=less&\"\n\n\n/* normalize component */\nimport normalizer from \"!../../node_modules/@vue/cli-service/node_modules/vue-loader/lib/runtime/componentNormalizer.js\"\nvar component = normalizer(\n  script,\n  render,\n  staticRenderFns,\n  false,\n  null,\n  null,\n  null\n  \n)\n\nexport default component.exports","var render = function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _c('div',{staticClass:\"kiwi-settings-advanced\"},[_c('div',{staticClass:\"kiwi-settings-advanced-notice\"},[_vm._v(_vm._s(_vm.$t('settings_advanced_header')))]),_c('form',{staticClass:\"u-form\"},[_c('div',{staticClass:\"kiwi-settings-advanced-filter-container\"},[_c('input',{directives:[{name:\"model\",rawName:\"v-model\",value:(_vm.filterString),expression:\"filterString\"}],staticClass:\"u-input\",attrs:{\"placeholder\":_vm.$t('settings_advanced_filter')},domProps:{\"value\":(_vm.filterString)},on:{\"input\":function($event){if($event.target.composing){ return;
